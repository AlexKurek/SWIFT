generate and evolve a disk-patch, where gas is in hydrostatic
equilibrium with an imposed external gravutation force, using teh
equations from Creasey, Theuns & Bower, 2013, MNRAS, Volume 429,
Issue 3, p.1922-1948

Run the swift using setting
#define EXTERNAL_POTENTIAL_DISK_PATCH
#define EXTERNAL_POTENTIAL_DISK_PATCH_ICs
#define ISOTHERMAL_GLASS (20.2615290634))
undefine EOS_IDEAL_GAS
in const.h.

Generate ICs (pythin makeIC.py)
run this using disk-patch-icc.py 
(1) imposing the gas remains isothermal
(2) particles suffer a viscous force
(3) the gravitational force increases from 0 to its full value in 5
dynamica times


Then, use the output as new initial conditions, run using
#define EXTERNAL_POTENTIAL_DISK_PATCH
only, and see whether it stays in hydrotatic equilibrium
Use disk-patch.yml as parameter file
