   * method also prevents any correlation between different random number 
   * types.
   * The calculation overflows on purpose.  
   * 1. The first step is calculating the seed by using a multiply with carry
   * (MWC) method, this method depends on the type of random number and 
   * this therefore also prevents that there is any correlation between 
   * the different types of random numbers.
   * 2. After this we use the 64 bit Xorshift method to randomize the seeds
   * even more. 
   * 3. We calculate a prime multiplication for the id with a quadratic
   * term.
   * 4. We calculate the seed by using a Quadratic congruential generator,
   * in which we use the id part and the current time step bin.
