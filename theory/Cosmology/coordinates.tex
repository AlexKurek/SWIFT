\subsection{Choice of co-moving coordinates}
\label{ssec:ccordinates}

Note that unlike the \gadget convention we do not express quantities
with ``little h'' included. We hence use $\rm{Mpc}$ and not
$\rm{Mpc}/h$ for instance. Similarly, the time integration operators
(see below) also include an $h$-factor via the explicit appearance of
the Hubble constant.\\
